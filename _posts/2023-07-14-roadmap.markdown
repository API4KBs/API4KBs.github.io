The recent timeline of the [standard](https://www.omg.org/spec/API4KP/)

* 08/20: API4KP 1.0-Alpha published
* 04/21: API4KP 1.0-Beta1 published
* 02/23: API4KP 1.0-Beta2 published
* 09/23: API4KP 1.0, 1.1-Alpha (projected)

At the time of this post, the codebase is still based on 1.0-Alpha, but also contains some fixes and/or ideas that will be incorporated in version 1.1.
The current plans are to upgrade the core implementation, and realign to 1.0/1.1-Alpha during Q3 2023 - in fact, the development is ongoing as I am writing this post.
